# Moving-Terrain

I created a Minecraft-like terrain using Perlin noise in P5js. Based on noise, it generates different colors for terrain and generates clouds. It also adds Minecraft trees on grassy terrain blocks.

I have always been interested in Minecraft and its terrain generation so I decided to take up this project. You can check it out [here](https://sainitind.github.io/Moving-Terrain/) (note the website does run slow so I'd recommend cloning the project and running it locally).
