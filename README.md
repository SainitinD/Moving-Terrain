# Moving-Terrain

Created a minecraft-like terrain using perlin noise in P5js. Based on noise, it generates different colors for terrain and generates clouds. It also adds minecraft trees on grassy terrain blocks.

I have always been interested in minecraft and its terrain generation so decided to take up this project. You can check it out [here](https://sainitind.github.io/Moving-Terrain/) (note the program does run a bit slow on the website).
